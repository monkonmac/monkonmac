I am a programmer by habit. But apart from it I love mentoring people, working with startups, helping people wherever I can. I am very well versed with full stack development means web/desktop/mobile/cloud/meta. I am addicted a lot to ❤ coffee ❤. P.S: Don't think I am a nerd :D

👀 I’m interested in working on real world problems that can make people happy.
🌱 I’ve 7+ years of experience working on android application development.
